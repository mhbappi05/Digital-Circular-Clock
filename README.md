# Digital-Circular-Clock
## Circular Digital Clock with Animated Arcs
This project is a visually appealing circular digital clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features three concentric animated arcs representing seconds, minutes, and hours, surrounding a clean, spacious center displaying the digital time and AM/PM indicator in a single horizontal line.

## Features
Animated circular progress arcs for seconds, minutes, and hours using SVG and stroke-dashoffset.

Large empty center space for clear digital time display.

Responsive and modern design with customizable colors and stroke widths.

Uses Google Fonts 'Orbitron' for a sleek digital-style numeric display.

Lightweight and easy to integrate into any webpage or project.

## How It Works
The clock uses SVG circles with carefully calculated circumferences. JavaScript updates the stroke offsets every second to animate the arcs according to the current time, while the digital clock updates simultaneously.

## Usage
Just open the index.html in any modern web browser. Customize colors, sizes, and fonts easily via CSS.
